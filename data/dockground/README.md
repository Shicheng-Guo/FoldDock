Dimeric structures from Dockground unbound benchmark set 4 (http://dockground.compbio.ku.edu/unbound/request.php)

- PDB folder contains 6 structures for each complex, named PDBid_xx.pdb. Suffixes xx stays for: 
    - u1: unbound longer chain (superposed to the bound counterpart)
    - u2: unbound shorter chain (superposed to the bound counterpart)
    - uc: unbound complex (u1 and u2 in the same structure)
    - b1: bound longer chain
    - b2: bound shorter chain
    - bc: bound complex

- fasta folder contains sequences of each individual unbound chain in dockground benchmark set 4 in FASTA format.

- codes_cb.csv files is a list with each line containing: bound complex PDB id, residue index of shorter chain's first amino acid.
